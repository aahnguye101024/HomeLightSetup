# HomeLightSetup
This project features 2 boards that work together to turn on strips of SK9822 wirelessly and either turn on them using my iphone with shortcuts through wifi or through the main board through a cap touch interface. The main board having an esp32 pico d4 with an antenna for WiFi access, a cap touch ic, and additions to support a lipo battery. The auxiliary board features an esp32 pico d4 with an antenna to communicate with the main board and a hefty 12V to 5V buck to run lights off of.
